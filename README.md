# Firewall Comparison Project â€“ pfSense vs nftables

This project compares two firewall solutions â€” **pfSense** (GUI-based) and **nftables** (CLI-based) â€” in a virtualised network environment.

## ðŸ§  Overview
- Designed and tested firewall configurations in VirtualBox using **Debian** and **pfSense**.  
- Performed penetration tests using **Kali Linux** and **Nmap** to evaluate rule enforcement.  
- Analysed results for security effectiveness, usability, and flexibility.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
pfSense â€¢ nftables â€¢ Kali Linux â€¢ Nmap â€¢ SSH â€¢ Debian â€¢ VirtualBox

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- Network segmentation and rule-based access control.  
- Penetration testing methodology.  
- Real-world firewall configuration and performance evaluation.
